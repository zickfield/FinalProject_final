# Very Best / Auth

## Introduction

Do you know who serves your favorite bagel in Chicago? How about your favorite burger? This application will allow you to keep track.

In this phase, we'll practice allowing users to sign in and manage their own favorites. We'll be using the [Devise](https://gist.github.com/rbetina/9ef4a9ffa4604df74bb5) gem.

## Setup

 1. `cd` into the application's root folder.
 1. `bundle install`
 1. `rake db:migrate`
 1. `rails s`

**Don't `rake db:seed` yet.**
